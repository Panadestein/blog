#+TITLE: The Hartree-Fock implementation from Szabo-Ostlund

This is pretty much the original code listed in Appendix B of the legendary [[https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486691862][book]]. It has some
minimal modifications introduced [[http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/FORTRAN/szabo/index.html][here]]. Compiling it is not so easy anymore, but it is still
possible with legacy options:

#+begin_src bash
  gfortran -o hfzo hf_so.f -std=legacy
#+end_src
