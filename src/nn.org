** Preface

We will implement a fully-connected feed-forward neural network[fn:1], in other words, a

#+begin_export html

<summary>Multilayer perceptron</summary>
#+end_export

Essentially an optimization problem of a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\)
that has exceptionally good properties for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem][approximating]] other continuous functions on compact subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) of \(L\) layers including inputs \(x_i\) and outputs \(y_i\) has the following recursive definition:

\begin{equation*}
  f = \begin{cases}
    z_i^{(0)} = x_i & \\
    z_i^{(l)} = \sigma\left( \sum_{j=1}^{N_{l-1}} w_{ij}^{(l)}\, z_j^{(l-1)} + b_i^{(l)} \right) & l \in [1, L]\\
    z_i^{(L)} = y_i & 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

where \(z_i^{(l)}\) is the activation of the layer \(l\), \(w_{ij}^{(l)}\) is the weight connecting the \(j\)-th
neuron in layer \(l-1\) to the \(i\)-th neuron in layer \(l\), \(b_i^{(l)}\)‚Äã is the bias for the \(i\)-th
neuron in layer \(l\), \(N_l\) is the number of neurons in layer \(l\), and \(\sigma\) is the activation function
(the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function][logistic function]] in our case).

As a reference implementation, we will use [[https://github.com/glouw/tinn][Tinn]], which is a MLP of a single hidden layer, written in pure C with
no dependencies. As usual, we will set the stage by importing the necessary utility functions:

#+begin_src bqn :tangle ./bqn/nn.bqn
  Setplot‚ÄøPlot ‚Üê ‚Ä¢Import "../bqn-utils/plots.bqn"
#+end_src

** Tinn's diminution

The C implementation has 175 lines excluding the optimization loop. The BQN version has only

#+begin_src bqn :tangle ./bqn/nn.bqn
  _minn ‚Üê {
    
  }
#+end_src

Training the MLP involves a two-stage process for each input: forward propagation followed by backpropagation,
during which we compute the total error. The second step is usually introduced with an air of mystery,
even though it is only

** Learning the logistic map

=_minn= should handle digit recognition just fine[fn:2]. However, I would like to switch clich√©s for the demonstration.
Instead, we will use it to learn the logistic map[fn:3]. This is a quintessential example of how chaos can emerge from simple systems.
Moreover, it is not so trivial to approximate: the recurrence lacks a [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticMap.html][closed-form]] solution, and has been the subject of
neural network research studies[fn:4].

Let‚Äôs see if we‚Äôve gotten the numbers right after learning. But then again, what is a number that a man may know it[fn:5]...

[fn:1] This post is not intended to be an introduction to the topic. There are excellent
[[https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks][videos]], [[https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/web/course.html][lecture notes]], and [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09384][papers]] that do this better than I could. I will provide just the
necessary context to make the read self-contained.
[fn:2] You can try using UCI's [[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/178/semeion+handwritten+digit][Semeion Handwritten Digit]] dataset, like Tinn does.
[fn:3]  Isn't it fascinating how closely related and yet so different the logistic map and the logistic function are?
The former can be thought of as a discrete version of the logistic differential equation \(\dot{f} = f(1 - f)\),
but whereas this ODE has a boring sigmoid solution, the logistic map yields beautiful bifurcation diagrams.
[fn:4] See, for instance, [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07468][arXiv:2409.07468]].
[fn:5] ... and a man that he may know a number? So [[https://www.nsl.com/k/parry/mcculloch_what-is-a-number.pdf][spoke]] Warren McCulloch, a truly inspiring figure.
