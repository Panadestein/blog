** Prelude

We will build an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme programming language,
following an [[https://www.norvig.com/lispy.html][essay]] by Peter Norvig. An alternative reference would
have been of course SICP's metacircular evaluator[fn:1], but I consider =lispy= to be
a very elegant implementation targeting a non-Lisp host[fn:2].

/Achtung/: this post is a learning exercise. Most of what I’ve learned about
language implementation comes from self-study of a handful of books[fn:3].

** A R5RS dialect

Our goal is to adhere to the Revised\(^5\) Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme ([[https://conservatory.scheme.org/schemers/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs.html][R5RS]]).
However, seasoned schemers will quickly notice that our implementation still has
quite some distance to cover in reaching full compliance. Let's start by defining some
utilities. It is unfortunate that the 1-modifier is required,
given that Booleans are not that [[https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/tutorial/combinator.html#booleans][special]].

** A Lisp quine

Given the title of this post, it seems only fitting to test our interpreter
with a quine:

#+begin_src bqn :tangle ./bqn/si.bqn :exports both
  Scheme "((lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
           (quote (lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "((lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
:          (quote (lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))"

Naturally, we can do more rigorous tests by comparing to my favorite Scheme
implementation[fn:4]. To achieve this, we'll leverage BQN's
foreign function interface:

#+begin_src bqn :tangle ./bqn/si.bqn :results none
  ch ← "../supp/chicken/libchicken.so" •FFI "*u8"‿"eval_scheme"‿">*u8:c8"
  R5RS ← {@+𝕩.Read¨ ↕1⊸+•_while_(0≠𝕩.Read)0}Ch∾@
#+end_src

But fear not, there’s no room for monotony here. After all,
people much prefer dealing with machinery to dealing with bureaucracies[fn:5]:

#+begin_src bqn :tangle ./bqn/si.bqn :exports both
  ("Not Compliant"⊸!Scheme≡R5RS)¨ "(+ 10 122)"‿"(* 4 2)"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ⟨ ⟨ "(+ 10 122)" "132" ⟩ ⟨ "(* 4 2)" "8" ⟩ ⟩

If you manage to find any sneaky corner cases that break the interpreter, do let me know!

[fn:1] I recommend SICP as further reading. Much like Louis Reasoner, I attempted
solving all the problems in the book, but I haven't gotten very far.
I believe there are some interesting Racket bits in my [[https://panadestein.github.io/solved-sicp/][solutions]], though.
[fn:2] I am not alone in this view; for instance, the [[https://www.fluentpython.com/][Lizard Book]] dedicates
an entire section to it.
[fn:3] For instance [[https://craftinginterpreters.com][Crafting Interpreters]] and [[https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/][Introduction to Compilers and Language Design]].
[fn:4] One of my favorite hacker guidelines is [[http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/articles/brutalist-manifesto.txt][The Brutalist Programming Manifesto]],
written by the creator of Chicken Scheme.
