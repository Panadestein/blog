Welcome to the source code of my blog. Here, I delve into solving computational
and algorithmic problems across various disciplines using my preferred tool of thought.

*Disclaimer*:

I primarily write for myself, and these posts are a collection of ideas I've encountered during my intellectual wanderings.
Nevertheless, should you find anything here of use, it would bring me great joy.

I've often challenged myself: "You're not a [[https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html][real programmer]] if you can't implement this from scratch." However, being too lazy to write hundreds
of lines of code, this didn't happen until I discovered the terseness and expressive power of BQN.

And rest assured, the code on this site doesn't look like Brainfuck, nor does it conform to any of [[https://aplwiki.com/wiki/File:Aplbingo.png][these]] clich√©s.

** Ethos

- *Low Dependency*: the site is generated using only Emacs' =ox-html=, with a thin CSS layer to accommodate the [[https://dzaima.github.io/BQN386/][BQN386]] font.
- *Literate programming*: each blog post is an =org-mode= computational notebook that can be opened and interacted with in Emacs.
- *Minimalist aesthetic*: the site has a monochromatic theme, because it is [[https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/expression.html#role-spellings][straightforward]] to read BQN without syntax highlighting.
- *Focus on BQN*: all problems are treated in BQN, using array and functional style as much as possible.
